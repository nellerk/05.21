            <h3>History of our company</h3>
            <h5>The Beginnings</h5>
            <p>The history of AutóRent Ltd. dates back more than two decades. Our company was founded in 2002 by István Kovács and Péter Nagy, two childhood friends who have always been passionate about cars. They both worked in the automotive industry, but always dreamed of starting their own business. Seeing how narrow and inflexible the domestic car rental market is, they decided to create a company that focuses on the needs of its customers.</p>

            <h5>First Steps</h5>
            <p>Our first office was in a small rented garage in Budapest, where we started with just five cars. Despite initial difficulties, thanks to our commitment and customer satisfaction, we soon started to grow. Our fleet of cars grew steadily and we attracted more and more people through our flexibility and excellent customer service.</p>

            <h5>Growth and Development</h5>
            <p>By the early 2010s we had a fleet of over 50 cars and opened our first rural office in Győr. Thanks to the innovative thinking of the company's founders, AutóRent Kft. was the first to introduce an online booking system in Hungary, which revolutionised the Hungarian car rental market. Customers could now conveniently book a car from the comfort of their home or office and pick it up at the location of their choice.</p>

            <h5>A Present</h5>
            <p>Today we offer more than 500 cars, from small city cars to luxury sedans and family-sized vans. We have more than 10 offices nationwide and we are proud to say that AutóRent Kft. is one of the leading car rental providers in Hungary. Our staff are constantly training to keep up to date with the latest technologies and trends, and to provide the highest quality service to all our customers.</p>

            <h5>Our vision for the future</h5>
            <p>Our company's core philosophy has remained the same since the beginning: customer satisfaction comes first. We will continue to strive to provide the most modern, convenient and reliable car rental service. Our aim is to become one of Europe's leading car rental providers by 2030, constantly expanding our fleet and services.</p>

            <h5>The AutóRent Ltd. story is one of perseverance, innovation and customer-centric thinking. We welcome you to be part of our success story and experience what a truly hassle-free car rental experience is like!</h5>
